# Password Checking
A function that asks the user to input a password. The function will then:

1. Make sure that the password is at least 8 characters long.

2. Make sure that each character does not occur more than 2 times in the word (meaning that the same character may be repeated 2 times maximum but no more than that)

3. Make sure the password contains at least one number

4. Make sure the password contains at least one of the following special characters: \*, # or $.

If the password fulfills all of the above, a message will be printed out to the screen stating that the password has been accepted. If not you should display a message stating what exactly is wrong with the provided password. Note that the password is case sensitive.
